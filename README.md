This is a library intended to cover the contents of ITU's linear algebra and probability course.
The library will encompass:
*A vector data type
*A matrix data type
*Gauss-Jordan elimination
*Eigenvalues and eigenvector derivation
*Matrix projection
*Matrix diagonalization
*Pagerank algorithm
*Random variables
*Conditional random variables
*Composition of random variables

And probably a lot more.
